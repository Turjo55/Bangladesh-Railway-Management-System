                            Bangladesh Railway began its journey on November 15, 1862, with the opening of 53.11 km of
                            broad gauge line between Darsana and Jagati. It was part of the immense railway network
                            established by the British in the Indian subcontinent. It played a vital role in the
                            economic development of the region, facilitating trade and transport of goods like jute and
                            tea.

                            After the partition of India in 1947, the railway in East Bengal became the Eastern Bengal
                            Railway (EBR). In 1961, it was renamed Pakistan Eastern Railway (PER). During this period,
                            significant expansion occurred, but the infrastructure suffered damage during the
                            independence war.

                            Following the liberation of Bangladesh in 1971, the network became Bangladesh Railway. It
                            has since undergone modernization, with the introduction of intercity trains, computerized
                            ticketing, and dual-gauge tracks. Today, it remains the principal mode of mass transport in
                            the country, connecting major districts and contributing to the national economy.
